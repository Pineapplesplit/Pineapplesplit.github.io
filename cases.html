                 <p>One of our favorite products that we sell are the pen cases. Each pen case is a trapezoid made of wood that can hold one pen each. It is complete with a hinge and a perfectly tailored hole for the pen to fit it. These aren't required to buy for your pen, but will ensure the pen or pencil you buy will stay of the utmost quality for a very long time.
